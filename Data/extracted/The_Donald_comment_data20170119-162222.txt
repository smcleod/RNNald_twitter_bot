Body: The reason that the system is catering to them is because a teacher's evaluation sets the bar so incredibly low that there is no accountability to their actual performance.<S>Hell, half of the evaluation is literally showing up with a course outline that you'll presumably go through.<S>Even the concept that teachers are ""teaching to the test" is exactly the regurgitation of same old crap you berated without actually recognizing the need for levels of standardization and the realization that autonomy is about HOW you teach the information rather than what information gets taught."<S>It isn't regurgitation.<S>It is first hand knowledge.<S>I live it every day  through my wife's experiences.<S>She teaches 9th grade cp and honors english.<S>It can vary from district to district.<S>In her current position they do loosen the reigns a bit.<S>In her previous position, the administration was so concerned with testing that they did not allow teachers to create their own lessons.<S>They were handed a binder with, essentially, a syllabus outlining the required courswork, novels and timeline that was to be taught.<S>There would also be bi-weekly "benchmark" testing.<S>These benchmark tests would include at least one day of practice.<S>So that was 2 days out of every other week devoted to tests to drill for the official standardized testing that the school would then be evaluated on.<S>The system is fucked.<S>Yes, firing a bad teacher is a pain in the ass process.<S>But the union is necessary if for nothing else than to recruit people who actually want to teach.<S>You have to give them something.<S>Except for a few supremely affluent school districts, teachers get paid dick for the amount of hours they work, amount of education required to get into the field, amount of bullshit they have to swallow from disrespectful students, parents who don't care, overbearing administrators, and people like you who think everything is their fault.<S>Frankly I have no idea why anyone would sign up to be a teacher other than their desire to help young people.<S>It certainly isn't for the pay check or schedule (she works 60-70hrs a week).<S>It certainly isn't for the glamour of the position.<S>There is a ton wrong with the public education system in this country.<S>Ineffective teachers are on that list.<S>But I would argue they are a much smaller part of the problem than you would suggest.<S>As I said to someone else.<S>The theory of charter schools is good.<S>The reality is not what you think.<S>I read the transcripts every day in my position in college admissions.<S>With a few exceptions (certain charter schools that focus on math &amp; science), they mirror the transcripts of public high schools.<S>They do not automatically perform better by virtue of being privatized.<S>It just isn't the case.<S>
