Title: As a woman, this march is completely embarrassing.<S>These liberals have to look up in order to see the gutter.<S>
Body: Funny, was just on the phone with my boyfriend telling him this exact thing.<S>I kept saying to him, "I'm so embarrassed.<S>I'm ashamed of this."<S>
Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>

Title: MORNING/AFTERNOON MAGATHREAD - 1/21/17 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP EDITION<S>
Body: Let's not downplay JFK.<S>he was the last faithful bluedog democrat.<S>
Title: I can't stop laughing my ass off at the fact that the Reddit page dedicated to President Trump is the most heavily censored on the site for literally no other reason than the fact admins disagree with us.<S>
Body: They saw the chants of "kill all who insult Islam" and thought to themselves, that's something we can double down on.<S>Turns out, stupid idea.<S>
Title: Billionaire George Soros has ties to more than 50 ‚Äòpartners‚Äô of the Women‚Äôs March on Washington<S>
Body: Report them.<S>They don't need to lose their job (and you can also say that when reporting them), but they need to shut the fuck up and stop making another employee hate coming to work because they can't act like a fucking ~~white male~~ adult.<S>
Title: That stare...<S>
Body: I saw him check out micheles ass<S>
Title: WE ARE THE_DONALD and we support blacks, browns, whites, gays, women, men, transgenders, truth, freedom, speech, peaceful religions, justice, independent press, and HIGH ENERGY!<S>We implore you to join us in Making America Great Again, TOGETHER!<S>

Title: There is a Capitalist in the White House!<S>
Body: It is like a part two of her "Communist in the White House."<S>
Title: WE ARE THE_DONALD and we support blacks, browns, whites, gays, women, men, transgenders, truth, freedom, speech, peaceful religions, justice, independent press, and HIGH ENERGY!<S>We implore you to join us in Making America Great Again, TOGETHER!<S>
Body: You said man made climate change is most likely bullshit.<S>I pointed out  as a very simple cause and effect to show you that you are wrong.<S>All this other stuff is another conversation I dont really care to have.<S>I never said that we should stop burning fossil fuels, but I believe that we need to take very large steps towards renewable resources (especially since fossil fuels are finite), not have a president who thinks that climate change is a "Chinese hoax" who wants to expand coal, whose party takes money from coal lobbyists and calls its "clean coal" in their platform.<S>For instance, Elon Musk says that he believes that 100 giga factories could supply all the power for the world, but as a company, Tesla couldnt build those alone.<S>
Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>

Title: Just Wanted To Take A Moment To Point Out That Republicans Never Really Attacked Attacked Sasha Or Malia For The Entirety Of Obama's Presidency.<S>The Democrats Can't Even Get Past The Inauguration Without Attacking Barron Trump<S>
Body: Unsubstantiated accusations on AOL?<S>LOL, fake news at its best!<S>
Title: Stefan Molyneux: It would have taken two minutes for Obama or Hillary to condem the violent protests and call for their end.<S>Their silence is approval.<S>
Body: Did Obama ever say a word when that mentally handicapped white kid got kidnapped and tortured by people who "could have been his son/daughter"?<S>
Title: TFW your sleeper-cell cover is blown after your asset fails her mission to overthrow America and returns you to your Saudi overlords to face the consequences.<S>
Body: [succubus](<S>
Title: That awkward moment when you feminists march for Islam and it totally disagrees with you.<S>üòÇüòÇüòÇ<S>
Body: They can't allow facts to interfere with their "crusade" against men.<S>
Title: I can't stop laughing my ass off at the fact that the Reddit page dedicated to President Trump is the most heavily censored on the site for literally no other reason than the fact admins disagree with us.<S>

Title: Did anyone else see this beautiful American at the MAGA Celebration?<S>
Body: Damn.<S>She's cute.<S>

Body: Same here.<S>I have better things to do with my time, like clean my house and spend time with my kid and my amazing husband...oh and smiling because Trump is my president.<S>Feminism is so out of whack.<S>I don't get what their point is in protesting.<S>Protesting what exactly??<S>Woman have more rights in America than anywhere else.<S>We can vote, we can own property, we can do whatever the hell we want.<S>There is no wage gap, the glass ceiling was shattered a long time ago.<S>They currently already have the right to murder their unborn children.<S>Maybe we should ALL go back to the kitchen and focus on our families, then perhaps the special snowflake children would actually become productive adults.<S>I prefer to be feminine not a feminist.<S>

Title: Autistic Screeching<S>
Body: This is epic!<S>
Title: Q: Are men really falling all over themselves to impregnate these NASTY WOMEN?<S>
Body: Sadly yes, there are more betas and cucks than there are alpha males.<S>
Title: ANOTHER VERIFIED JOURNALIST ATTACKING BARRON TRUMP!<S>LOW, PATHETIC, AND SAD!<S>
