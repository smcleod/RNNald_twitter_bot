Title: Coming out of the closet for Trump story - My girlfriend just got mad that I said Trump is a good person.<S>
Body: YMMV, but I've found that you can Overdose people on the Red Pill if you aren't careful.<S>The best approach, imo, is to take it one false assumption at a time, and have them, or help them fact check a lie against Trump.<S>Sometimes you have to start with showing MSM media blatantly lying and getting caught, and working up from there.<S>On the lie that he made fun of a handicapped person,  I would have said something like "I remember hearing that, did you ever see the video of it?
