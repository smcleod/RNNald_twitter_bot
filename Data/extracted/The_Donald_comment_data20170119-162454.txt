Body: I mean, on one hand, it would be nice if certain organizations got out of their comfort zones and looked for people outside of their normal hiring channels.<S>For example, the Department of State generally only hires graduates of Georgetown for higher level positions.<S>I would argue they are ignoring a vast majority of the country and applicants that could be just as good as, if not better than, graduates of Georgetown.<S>Georgetown is a big name in foreign affairs, but by no means is it the be all end all as a source for future members of the diplomatic corps.<S>Of course, diversity hiring doesn't apply to the government and particularly not those higher level positions - the government always conveniently exempts itself from what it imposes on everyone else.<S>
