Title: The left launches attack on Ben Swann's Pizzagate segment (which he repeatedly stated there is no proof that it's true).<S>Even mentioning Pizzagate is a crime--INVESTIGATE NOW!<S>
Body: You said it!<S>When Pizzagate started picking up steam, that's when the left started pushing the fake news meme.<S>Not to mention the sudden push for pedophilia normalization.<S>What ultimately lead me to believe that Pizzagate is real is the way they react to it.<S>They're scared to death of being exposed.<S>
Title: Speaking of "rigged elections," what about Obama rigging the 2012 election by using the IRS to suppress Tea Party groups?<S>There is more evidence &amp; data to suggest it affected that election than with Russia and Trump, yet the MSM never once dared to suggest Obama was illegitimate.<S>
Body: 1) Here's a summary of events up to june 2016    The targeting happened.<S>The amazing thing is, the question of who gave the order for the IRS to target still has never been answered.<S>But the one thing the white did do is never get their story straight on how they found out about it:  Obama's response, which was nothing- is telling.<S>he didn't fire, sanction, or reprimand anyone, and famously said there's "not a smidgen of corruption" at the IRS, which is laughable.<S>But Obama is president, it's his administration, he specifically benefited from the targeting, and presidents are always responsible for their administration's actions.<S>Its possible we will know more about it if Trump's DOJ wants to pursue it- but that seems unlikely- and of course, Obama's deeply corrupt DOJ was never going to touch it.<S>But much like Hillary's emails or Benghazi, the democrats used the DOJ not pursuing charges as a way of claiming exoneration from all wrongdoing.<S>Which is where we are today.<S>2)No, I'm not kidding Carl.<S>I stand by that the MSM never suggested Obama wasn't legitimately elected- and to your typical point, you're wrong- birtherism was never a MSM-propagated thing- even on the hated FAUX NEWS  (if you even count FOX as mainstream, which is debatable)  About the only time birtherism got play on MSM was when it was time to RIDICULE those that pushed it.<S>"Birtherism" was on a loop on MSNBC to show how racist Obama's opposition was.<S>I did you the courtesy of providing links that you could've found yourself if you were capable.<S>Now I challenge YOU to back up YOUR assertion.<S>Find one video clip of anyone of FAUX NEWS legitimately pushing the birther story without heavy scrutiny or challenging it.<S>I will stand corrected if you find it, but I'm very confident- this is my realm bub.<S>I've been living here for years.<S>You are just driving by.<S>
