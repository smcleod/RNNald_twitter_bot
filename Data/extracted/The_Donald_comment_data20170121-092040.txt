Title: Your President's face when paralyzed veterans went by in the parade.<S>(link in comments)<S>
Body: Britain<S>
Title: Revoke Buzzfeed's White House pass after fake allegations against the president<S>
Body: I want to see an Infowars White House correspondent, someone like Owen Shroyer<S>
Title: I don't think I've ever hated anything more in my life than these violent, lying, hypocritical, treasonous liberals.<S>
Body: It's going to take a generation or more to make an impact on these people's brainwashing.<S>An 18 year old now has grown up under Obama and the perverse culture he espoused.<S>They don't know any different, and none of them learn any history at all.<S>
Title: Sorry.<S>I can't stop laughing.<S>Besides, impeaching Clinton would've been easier than hacking Podesta.<S>
Body: This is scary.<S>They succeeded with their celebrity psa's...wait, their white supremacy/racist slurs...wait no, Russian hackers..no again.<S>Oh I know they used Federal 48 to change the minds of Electors and give the Presidency to Hillary...shit no again.<S>But their fake news "dossier" kept him out of office...nope.<S>Michael Moore was surely able to rally the hordes and resist...no.<S>The "peaceful" riots changed the minds of real Americans who asked to change their votes...wrong again.<S>Sitting on the ground screaming Nooooooooo as he was sworn in made Trump leave the office...nope just turned into a meme.<S>See the pattern?<S>If it looks, smells and sounds like a bunch of whiny losers, it is a bunch of whiny losers.<S>
Title: Yeah, buckle up, it's about to get crazy<S>
Body: From the CIA files we know there are multiple origins of these visitors.<S>FBIAnon indicated this as well.<S>Trump said it was our last chance.<S>The FBI Vault, CIA files, and Wikileaks (not just podesta emails) all indicated that the government fears a religious crisis over the revelation if it were to be openly discussed as fact.<S>What I think Trump might be doing is this...<S>When your whole belief system, everything you knew, falls apart.<S>When everybody in government and science is telling you a story that you don't want to believe, well, you will just tune them out, that is how people work.<S>Cognitive dissonance and all.<S>By pacing, Trump is preventing himself from being tuned out, and more than that, setting himself up to SLOWLY introduce new arguments and ideas into the group he is pacing, as they no longer see him as an outsider to the group they identify with.<S>When Trump puts forward an idea, the religious people he is pacing see that idea as one of thier own.<S>That's the basics of pacing and leading, I'm assuming the only leading he will be doing by this particular move is to redirect the anger and confusion that a large number of religious patriots will be feeling.<S>People don't do change that well and he is going to help.<S>
Title: I can't stop laughing my ass off at the fact that the Reddit page dedicated to President Trump is the most heavily censored on the site for literally no other reason than the fact admins disagree with us.<S>
Body: We collectively stopped buying gold when they censored us iniiltially so we don't generate revenue anymore.<S>And, as in traditional modern-day leftist dealings, rather than change it they double down.<S>I hope Trump turns out a good president for the next 4 years, because if he's even as decent as Obama he's in for 8 and that will give a new *Republican* candidate a chance to shine so that Democrats lose again.<S>I'm a classical liberal, I'm not Republican and nor am I Democrat.<S>But when you censor a movement that has been misrepresented through the media, and when you double down and say "Sorry guys but they had to go!"<S>then I want to spite those closed-minded bastards any way I can.<S>

Title: TFW you realize 200+ rioters will be getting slapped with a felony tonight and lose their right to vote.<S>

Title: Can we get some love for the man who red pilled our President?<S>
Body: And the Left (and the GOP for that matter) tried to paint him as a racist.<S>Dude fucking loved his country and all Americans, but they still made him out to be a black hating KKK sympathizer.<S>Sound familiar?<S>Democrats really don't have any kind of other narrative to use.<S>

Title: The Real Reason Trump Won.<S>
