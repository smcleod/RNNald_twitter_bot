Body: Trump is the only one saying it because Trump is an outsider and he just snuck his way into the most powerful position in the country.<S>See, the American political landscape is a good old boys club.<S>That's the Senate.<S>LBJ described the two houses as chicken salad and chicken shit.<S>A Senator has much more power and affluence than the House of Representatives.<S>Senate seats are mostly filled with political dynastical families having ties to old money.<S>The Senate is the closest thing we have to a House of Lords, the ruling class.<S>These people grew up together, went to the same schools, same clubs, played the same sports, participate in the same organizations, rule on the same corporate boards.<S>Their lives intersect like a Venn diagram (overlapping circles).<S>They are all very much in competition with one another, but, they are not in competition with the majority of us.<S>It is here where they have common interests, to enrich themselves, and why they can bipartisanly do it through legislation at the expense of the rest of us.<S>Then there is the House of Representatives.<S>This is the chicken shit LBJ referred to.<S>This is the political body that has the closest ties with the average American.<S>It's a much more diverse group made up of individuals from all strata of society.<S>As a whole, they have almost equal footing with the Senate.<S>As an individual they are much more powerless compared to a Senator and very much dependent upon a Senator's &amp; special interests patronage.<S>And then there are the regulatory bureaucracies.<S>Their leadership not surprisingly is often pulled from the captains of industry these agencies are intended to regulate.<S>And these are the same people whose lives intersect the lives of those in the Senate on very personal levels.<S>So, the Senate isn't saying anything about how they've enriched themselves at the expense of the people because it's an admission of guilt.<S>The House of Representatives aren't saying anything because that's career suicide.<S>The regulatory bureaucracies are silent because, well, they're not political and seeing how they're lead frequently by the interests they're supposed to regulate, what can they say?<S>The US is very much like the old Roman Empire in some respects, especially politically.<S>The US gives people the right to vote as a means to placate them.<S>Things are bad?<S>Oh, don't riot, just wait to vote.<S>It doesn't really amount to much power.<S>From the ruling class it's a compromise that leads to stability for them.<S>They control the bulk of the assets.<S>They control the bulk of the political system.<S>They control the MSM to sway opinion at their whim.<S>There's not much risk that the people are not going to vote for one or the other candidate that serves the elites' interests in some way.<S>It's a win win for the upper strata of society.<S>But, there is always the risk, however small that someone like Trump will come along.<S>And it is why Trump is being vilified.<S>Why every normal process of the change of government is being used to paint Trump as a destroyer.<S>All the ambassadors were fired?<S>Trump did it, even though it's a normal process of the change of power.<S>The Whitehouse website was torn down?<S>Trump did it, even though the previous administration takes it down to archive it for their Presidential library/legacy.<S>It's why Trump is a Russian operative even though Podesta receives money from Russia, why Trump is a sexual deviant who like golden showers while Willie has frequent flyer miles on the Lolita Express and why Trump is a racist who beat out a female candidate who absolutely leverages white male hatred.<S>Whatever may come of the next 4 or 8 years, if nothing else, I get to mine salt from the tears of SJWs.<S>
