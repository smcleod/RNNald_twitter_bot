Title: INAUGURATION DAY MAGATHREAD 3 - ARE YOU READY TO MAGA?<S>
Body: "For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.<S>Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.<S>Politicians prospered, but the jobs left.<S>And the factories closed.<S>The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.<S>Their victories have not been your victories.<S>Their triumphs have not been your triumphs.<S>And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.<S>That all changes starting right here and right now.<S>Because this moment is your moment.<S>It belongs to you.<S>It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.<S>This is your day.<S>This is your celebration.<S>And this, the United States of America, is your country.<S>What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.<S>January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.<S>The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.<S>....  We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.<S>From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.<S>From this day forward, it's going to be only America first -- America first.<S>Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.<S>We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.<S>Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.<S>I will fight for you with every breath in my body.<S>And I will never, ever let you down.<S>America will start winning again, winning like never before.<S>... ....  We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world.<S>But we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.<S>We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example.<S>We will shine for everyone to follow.<S>We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones.<S>And unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.<S>At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.<S>When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.<S>... ....<S>Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.<S>In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.<S>We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.<S>The time for empty talk is over.<S>Now arrives the hour of action.<S>Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.<S>No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.<S>We will not fail.<S>Our country will thrive and prosper again.<S>We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.<S>A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.<S>It’s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget -- that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.<S>We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.<S>... ...<S>So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words -- you will never be ignored again.<S>Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.<S>And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.<S>Together, we will make America strong again.<S>We will make America wealthy again.<S>We will make America proud again.<S>We will make America safe again.<S>And yes, together, we will make America great again.<S>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.<S>Thank you.<S>God bless America."<S>Full speech here:<S>
