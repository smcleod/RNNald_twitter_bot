Title: Reddit admins, are you salty ?<S>(ಥ‸ಥ)<S>
Body: &gt; Right now there are a bunch of IT dudes in front of a computer somewhere trying to 'fix' this while the triggered cuck mods are squealing in their ears.<S>I'm thinking they'll take their sweet time.<S>Haha.<S>Either way it's censorship and morally wrong.<S>Reddit did this to themselves.<S>You try to do this stuff and you just make The Donald more popular.<S>&gt;   Honestly, you probably won't like that, but I'm not a US american and I really do not like Trump and the direction he is taking, so it's nothing personal, really.<S>But I wanted to make sure that you weren't disrespected, for fairness.<S>So when I saw the post, I downvoted it for the lack of content, for it being mostly spam and asking for upvotes, which is, in my book, not something you want to encourage.<S>Disclaimer: I do not downvote T_D posts systematicaly, I'm being honest here.<S>But since it was clearly asking for upvotes, I decided to keep an eye on it, because I expected it to be downvoted to oblivion.<S>I came back to check over the course of maybe 30 minutes to an hour, and I saw it go down from 8k to 5k, eventually something like 600, and sure enough, 0.<S>I don't want to burst your bubble, but it didn't go down within a minute :/ I'm pretty sure it's people that want to be persecuted that took the occasion for what it wasn't<S>

Body: No no the media only classifies them as mediocre if they support Trump and support logical solutions.<S>If they diss Trump and have kneejerk emotional reactions and virtue signal often on social media no way they get called mediocre!<S>Instead they are treated to the spotlight to show how the brainwashed masses are "supposed" to react to fake news from our dear corporate leaders and their news networks.<S>
