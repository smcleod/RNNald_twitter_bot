Title: Hispanic Trump Supporter BEATEN UP By Anti-Trump Protestors at DeploraBall Last Night.... "TOLERANT" LEFT!<S>
Body: That doesn't discredit the ridiculous amounts of violent and disruptive protests.<S>Other groups of people aren't out purposely disrupting communities to make their shitty messages heard.<S>There are problems with the police, of course.<S>But to say they are racist and they are out murdering black people is completely false.<S>And profiling exists because black people commit a disproportional amount of crime.<S>To ignore that black people make up 13% of the population and commit 52% of all homicides is insane.<S>Gangs aren't an institution and they are still protesting as you claim.<S>Raising awareness of an issue can help.<S>But at the end of the day black people have to take personal responsibility for their lot in life.<S>You commit a crime, you might get shot.<S>You have 4 kids and no father, you'll be poor and your kids will be more likely to end up in jail.<S>You drop out of school you'll have a minimum wage job for the rest of your life.<S>And all of those decisions are their own individual fault, nobody else's.<S>I'm not racist but I can criticize a shitty culture when I see one.<S>

Title: Remember the Republicans got blamed for not working with the Democrats but still attended Obama's inauguration?<S>
Body: Throughout the Bush years when Republicans also had Congress the Democrats bitched about the 'rights of the minority (party)'.<S>So the GOP, being establishment morons, went along with it and gave them all sorts of extra power, which was immediately exploited against them.<S>Once they took over in 2007, the Democrats stopped all that power-sharing and in fact changed rules to make themselves even stronger.<S>Now they've been BTFO again and the power they wielded is now usable against them.<S>This time the GOP better not fuck it up.<S>
