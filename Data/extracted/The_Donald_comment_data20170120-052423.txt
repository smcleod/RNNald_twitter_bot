Title: One vote count Reddit can't roll back to zero<S>
Body: Um,  hate to break it to you.<S>But the coal industry is dying not because of environmentalists but because of the free market.<S>EPA regulations most definitely deterred the building of new coal plants.<S>But they are not the driving force behind its decline, shale fracking is.<S>Natural gas began becoming cheaper to manufacture and produce than the cost of coal mining.<S>You can thank the technology of fracking for that, which has increased the production by a factor of 10 and decreased the cost by about 60%.<S>Not to mention it's cheaper to pipe gas to transit than it is to pay to move coal via railroad.<S>"Between 2007 and 2015, shale gas prices dropped almost in half,Â positioning natural gas to outprice coal mined in four of the five U.S. coal regions...the benchmark gas prices ("Henry Hub" prices) in the past four years [have been] cheaper than the coal of the two regions in Appalachian for over 88% of the months.<S>Further, gas has been cheaper than the coal of Appalachia, Illinois, and the Rockies for over 57% of the months.<S>Even the cheapest coal, in Wyoming's Powder River Basin, competes poorly in the great population centers east of the Mississippi once rail transport of $0.03 per ton-mile is considered.<S>That prompted investment in pipelines and gas storage infrastructure that have made gas even more competitive."<S>If you're a power plant operator and you see gas supply is continuing to increase and natural gas can do the job cheaper -- by a lot -- the decision to switch from coal is pretty easy.<S>
Title: James O'Keefe of Project Veritas just announced his next target...<S>The dinosaur media.<S>Project Veritas already has moles.<S>They've been watching and listening behind the scenes, waiting to strike.<S>
Body: Imagine how easy it would be to plant people within these failing media outlets.<S>They are so strapped for cash due to declining advertising revenue that they probably hire ever more interns while trimming off those due for a raise or promotion.<S>Our local newspaper is certainly following that formula and it sure looks like corporate news is about to decline just like the daily newspapers have.<S>Those interns are either underpaid or working for free which means high turnover too so ample opportunities to insert spies.<S>
