Body: It's based on momentum, IIRC.<S>If a post makes it to 5000 in 5 minutes, it will rank higher than a post with 10000 that took 8 hours to get there.<S>Likewise, a post that loses 5000 votes in a short time will fall off /r/all faster than a post that loses 10000 votes over a long period.<S>The post in question went from ~6k to 0 instantly and maintained its position.<S>Could have been deliberate, could have been a weird bug.<S>

Title: Dear The_Donald<S>
Body: It is true that you have brought truth when others haven't E.X.<S>Orlando shooting, but just because you follow a specific ideology doesn't mean you should just ignore other groups, think about how much better this sub would be without all the shitty "HURR DURR PRESIDENT" memes, and was completely based on both positives and negatives of both Donald and the party, Obama became self-aware so maybe he will too, it would help.<S>Also, the more shit posts the more the internet hates you, you may say that relations don't need fixing but many people will see this sub and say "oh some of these guys are idiots, must mean Trump supporters are idiots" and frankly, I don't want that, I want respect for all parties involved: The_Donald, Reddit admins, and everyone in the middle.<S>
