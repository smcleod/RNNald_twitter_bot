Body: Thank you for identifying the biggest problem facing our nation.<S>More people need to think of the consequences of their actions and how they affect the greater world around them that way we could have strong leaders who can fix world problems and not have to deal with domestic ones such as an extremely divided nation.<S>Both parties need to be willing to come together on the middle ground and stop with the all or nothing mentality.<S>Party before country is a dangerous mentality no matter if it's the Democrats or Republicans.<S>That being said perhaps if you wanted more "limp wristed weak little sissies" to hear your opinion and value your insight, turn down the aggression and meet them in the middle.<S>It works wonders to be nice!<S>
