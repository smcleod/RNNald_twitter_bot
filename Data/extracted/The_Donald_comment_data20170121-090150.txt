Title: The Real Reason Trump Won.<S>
Body: &gt; It's true.<S>How many times in the past year have we heard, "these morons are voting against their own best interests!"<S>&gt; How the fuck would you know?!<S>In my opinion, it's mostly in the sense that Trump's policies and history fly in the face of his extreme campaign promises.<S>He claims to be for the middle class, and his first act in his office is to block a small upcoming mortgage discount for homeowners.<S>He claims to be for job creation, but in his business life he went bankrupt six or so times, and while he may feel like he is a genius for bankrupting a company and walking away with a $10 million golden parachute, what happened to the employees and all the company stock they were encouraged to buy?<S>He claims to be for small business owners, and yet more than 5,000 are suing him in court for unpaid bills.<S>He claims to be against cheap foreign labor and imports, and exclusively uses Mexican workers and Chinese steel.<S>I believe that working class Trump voters are voting against their own interests not because the promises he makes are against their interests, but the history and character of the man make it painfully obvious that he lacks the competence to deliver on those promises, and will only be delivering for his cronies (like every other politician).<S>&gt; Maybe we have different values.<S>Maybe we prioritise the health of the patriotic nation over getting handouts.<S>Maybe you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about because you're fresh out of your Social Studies degree and have zero life experience.<S>For those who only value flag-waving and verbal expressions of patriotism, Trump will deliver bigly.<S>But that is a low standard to meet.<S>Not popular sentiments here, obviously, but--who knows?<S>Let's see what everyone's opinions will be in two to four years.<S>So many of the insiders claim that underneath the impulsive idiot we all see in public, there is a humble, compassionate genius hiding underneath who, for some reason, only comes out when he's in a room alone with Newt, Bannon, or KAC.<S>But... that's a gigantic leap of faith.<S>I am pretty sure there's no "there" there.<S>
