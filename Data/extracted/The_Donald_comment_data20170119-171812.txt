Body: Yes, if the site was querying the database directly you would be right.<S>But reddits traffic is way to big for this so almost everything we see on here are cached data from their memcached cluster(s).<S>The actual data used to be stored in postgres(not sure if it still is), but all reads are done against the cache.<S>So the data we are seeing could be old compared to the data in the actual DB, yes.<S>I'd expect votes to be locally visible almost instantly in one part of the system and be propagated in batches to the rest of the system.<S>But I'll freely admit that all of this is speculation from an outsider with no way of knowing how things really work.<S>I'll also freely admit that this in no way proves that the admins didn't fuck with the post.<S>My only point is that it might just be artifacts from how distributed the system is.<S>If you are curious about reading on how reddit uses memcached they just posted a [ post) about it two days ago.<S>I haven't had time to read it myself yet, but maybe you'd find it interesting?<S>
