Title: Piers has lost all chill<S>
Body: The AR is a good weapon, especially since the recoil impulse is well tamed by its native caliber and the gas impingement system, which, vs the gas piston system, eliminates much of the mass that is in motion during recoil.<S>One of its drawbacks is the complexity of the design vs. the AK style guns, which the Valmet is a family member of, but one you get it down and practice it a bit, is no problem.<S>

Body: Thanks.<S>I wasn't trying to take that guy's job, I just really felt we could do this.<S>We were going up against all the big boys.<S>My key to getting our foot in the door was leaving our demo computer that we used to give our presentation with them afterwards.<S>They didn't believe that we really had all these features, that it was a canned demo.<S>I assured them this was a fully functional, although really small, system.<S>I forgot about it, and figured they had chose someone else.<S>Out of the blue they called me about two months later saying they were having a problem with "our system".<S>What are you talking about?<S>Turns out they were using it and it totally was not up to the task of what they were throwing at it.<S>The disk space was all used up and it couldn't purge off old data fast enough.<S>I laughed and explained the problem, and they asked me how soon I could have them a larger system to play with.<S>I said I will bring one up there personally tomorrow.<S>The current CTO tried to stop this from happening, saying we were just wasting our time, he'd seen this sort of thing before, they are just taking advantage of us, blah blah blah.<S>I told my boss that I really liked the people who I'd dealt with there and felt they were on the up and up.<S>Went up there, upgraded them, and then they laid out their grand plans and asked if we could do it.<S>I said yes.<S>My boss loved it, and the CTO tried to shut it down.<S>I was incredulous.<S>He didn't lift a finger to help, even though a lot of code was his and he just said "Change whatever, I don't care."<S>So I did.<S>

Title: Piers has lost all chill<S>
Body: I think they just have a very low opinion of other women.<S>They think that a woman is so fragile that when a big powerful man walks in the room and makes a move she must suddenly be incapable of consent... kind of like if she were passed or drunk.<S>Honestly I think this is what their subconscious is telling them.<S>To be fair, most college age women know someone who has been assaulted or who has been assaulted themselves, so they are projecting all their hatred of men who do such things onto Trump, because of his cavalier attitude in that video.<S>
Title: WE ARE THE_DONALD and we support blacks, browns, whites, gays, women, men, transgenders, truth, freedom, speech, peaceful religions, justice, independent press, and HIGH ENERGY!<S>We implore you to join us in Making America Great Again, TOGETHER!<S>
Body: Ugh.<S>Your situation is so much harder than mine, I can't even imagine what that must have been like.<S>&gt; I was always ashamed of the fact that I needed a handout.<S>You shouldn't!<S>It's a shame that many in this country try to make us feel that way, but the benefits are there so that we can do more than just subsist for the rest of our life; so that we can climb out of poverty and do something with our lives!<S>And it's not as if the super-wealthy aren't using welfare either!<S>They just go off a different name: "subsidy".<S>(Take for instance, the yacht tax break!)<S>&gt; I hope it isn't people like me that the fine folks in this thread are talking about....<S>I have never met anyone in my situation that is trying to "coast."<S>We're all hustling, going to school, working multiple part-time jobs all while trying to find the "real" job that will open the door to the middle class.<S>So when people talk about welfare recipients as passive and lazy, I wince; because I'm on welfare and I know people on welfare, and I don't know anybody that isn't busting their butt to get off it.<S>
