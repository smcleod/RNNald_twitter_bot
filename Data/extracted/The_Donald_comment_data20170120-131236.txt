Title: After so many irrational responses, I've given up on being polite and trying to have a legitimate discussion.<S>
Body: &gt; Im beginning to think r/redacted is just the victim of a targeted propaganda machine aimed to discredit Trump.<S>That's kinda what happened, but I think it's a bit more complex than that.<S>That subreddit has always gotten excited about certain candidates and been "grassroots" support, they did it for Ron Paul and they did it for Bernie Sanders.<S>However, they usually will turn somewhat reluctantly back to the "lesser of evils" argument.<S>In that situation those who care more about finance tend to say Republicans are "less evil" and those who care more about emotions, social justice, etc tend to say Democrats are "less evil".<S>What happened this time though was a bit different.<S>They were very clearly taken over for a long period of time, willingly or not, by Correct the Record and other paid propaganda.<S>The media played into this as well because it all goes back to advertising and who cares how insane you are as long as you get more clicks.<S>This pushed away more people than usual.<S>They also took over the administration and became far more strict about censoring anything that doesn't perfectly fit a narrative while allowing literally anything submitted from literally anywhere if it fits.<S>All of that combined to push all the reasonable people away.<S>If there's any wide lesson to be learned by this election it's that you don't win by attacking your own side or alienating your own people.<S>They chose to be divisive because they thought they had enough media control to make their side win, but they were wrong.<S>Now they are left with... whatever that subreddit is now..<S>It seems like 1/3rd trolls, 1/3 paid shills, and 1/3 poor people who got sucked in and have such a warped world view that they fit in perfectly with the trolls and shills.<S>
