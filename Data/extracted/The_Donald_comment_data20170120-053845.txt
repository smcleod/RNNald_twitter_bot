Title: Uhhh, guys?<S>Why did Obama pardon over 300 crack/cocaine/meth dealers yesterday, on his last day as President?<S>
Body: I'm assuming that they were people who got mandatory minimum life sentences for large quantities of crack or for the combo of crack and a gun.<S>I hate Obama as bigly as the next centipede,  but this might be something we can leave alone... the war on drugs has been a horrific and expensive failure and mandatory minimums for drugs don't really deter people from the business.<S>If anything the mandatory minimums make dealers and supplier more dangerous,  as they have a bigger incentive to be violent to avoid apprehension or deter witness testimony.<S>All this is predicated on my earlier assumption that they were all non violent first offenders.<S>He could have very well chosen to pardon scumbags who beat their wives and sell drugs to kids, I wouldn't really be surprised by anything Obama did this last week.<S>
