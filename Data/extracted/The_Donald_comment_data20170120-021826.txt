Body: This is bittersweet as a former Sanders supporter.<S>On one hand, FUCK YES!<S>On the other, it's a little sad that now, both Bernie and the world will never get to see how he would've done as president.<S>Ehh...he would probably fuck it up.<S>
Title: One vote count Reddit can't roll back to zero<S>
Body: I lurk this subreddit and don't particularly think the same way as you guys, but let me just say this, I try to be reasonable and use logic to determine my opinions...and trying to explain myself for the last 2 hours to the super liberal leftists...left me drained (check comment history for luls).<S>Keep the good fight going you trolls and memers.<S>
Title: The Hill: Sanders backers take over California Democratic Party (I think this is a MAJOR boost for the Calexit movement!<S>That referendum is in Spring of 2019 - see the site below)<S>
Body: Yeah... no.<S>Calexit is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.<S>I'm a little curious why you would be in favor of ceding any portion of the United States' Pacific coastal access?<S>Or any piece of California's economic contributions?<S>The whole idea seems pretty divisive and not in the country's best interests.<S>Imagine if Trump is able to un-cuck California -- seems like a better asset to have than to lose.<S>Not to say it wouldn't be hilarious if Los Angeles quit the U.S., failed as a city-state (obviously), and had to go join Mexico or something.<S>
Title: Prayer Group for President Trump's Inauguration: Can I get an Amen!<S>

Body: uncheck "use subreddit style" on the right to downvote<S>

Title: #Disruptj20 viciously attack deploraball attendees.<S>Will The MSM cover this or will they continue to be silent hypocrites when it doesn't fit their narrative?<S>
Body: That's because for some reason, of all days, everyone wants to join the "post the same trump picture" circlejerk, burying some of the more important things we should be reading about.<S>Don't get me wrong it was hilarious at first and I'm happy to piss off the admins and crybabies on r/all but after hours and hours of it, when do we decide enough is enough and worry about what's actually going on (especially today which will mark one of the most important days in US history)?<S>It's definitely the most important day that I've been alive as far as I'm concerned.<S>

Body: is that a salt mine you are going to produce during the next 8 years?<S>
Title: 8 years later, Barack Hussein Obama has yet to produce a legitimate birth certificate to prove that he was born in the United States of America.<S>
Body: Well that was kind of my point...everything I've read says she lived in the US her entire life up from 1942 up until giving birth to Barack in 1961...when she was 18.<S>Therefore she could not have met the requirement of living in the US for 5 years after the age of 14, but everything seems to say that she lived in the US for her entire childhood.<S>Which is why I asked if you had any evidence I wasn't aware of that this was not the case.<S>
