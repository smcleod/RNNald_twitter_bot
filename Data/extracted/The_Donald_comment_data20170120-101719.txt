Title: Centipedes...I fucked up.<S>
Body: I was in that same situation, I considered just not voting at all for a while, because at the time I viewed them both as equally bad...again, my initial perception of Trump was skewed by the media.<S>So I figured I would just not participate at all, but then if I was going to do that, I might as well at least throw some support behind a third party, maybe get one of them to 5%, so I'm doing *something*, but that was clearly the wrong move...fucking Harambe got more votes than Stein.<S>Definitely wouldn't be opposed to supporting a third party again in the future if there was one that wasn't completely batshit, just not in 2020, that vote is now spoken for.<S>Also, on your last point, what finally brought me around was a combination of seeing the constant bullying-by-way-of-pseudovictimhood by my liberal friends who I used to agree with on mostly everything, and the energy and positivity of this sub...once you get over the stigma, and wade through all the shitposts, you won't find a kinder, more accepting group of people on reddit.<S>
