Title: Please don't down vote me to oblivion, I just have a question.<S>
Body: Hmm Idn about it being so bad if we can never meet in the middle because, lets be honest, if things still generally "work out" then it's no big deal, 2018 and 2020 you can vote again, and that voting cycle is part of what keeps society moving forward, no total agreement needed!<S>But I also wonder if you have read the wikileaks and any of that?<S>Not to suggest that you would necessarily agree with any of what the commenter above you is saying, but even according to the US gov those emails are all accurate.<S>Have you sifted through them at all?<S>I would say, at least, they give a taste of how things can sometimes work "behind the scenes" and it can be ugly.<S>Peeling back those layers of information might help offer a bit more perspective?<S>For example maybe it will cause enough disillusionment in those you thought you "believed in" that you realize politics and government and being an informed citizen is a constant, uphill battle.<S>Though that may seem demoralizing, look at what's happening now, people have some momentum, people are at least willing to try and be a little more engaged.<S>Basically the point I'm trying to make is don't be too worried about agreeing in the end.<S>Keep engaging, and use what you learn to inform your decisions as you see fit, and honestly, truly, in the ling run all of us are better for it.<S>
