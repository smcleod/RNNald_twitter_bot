Body: I'm starting to think that these cuck threads are getting manipulated by the same admins that have been repeatedly caught changing the vote count to 0 for Trump's portrait, among other things.<S>This shit had no comments when it reached the front page, and half of them are telling OP is a virtue signaling cuck.<S>

Body: As Secretary of State, she was in charge of the Haiti relief fund and directing the billions of dollars from around the world donated to help haiti.<S>Clinton Cash and Wikileaks revealed how they directed the money to companies of their friends and donators to the Clinton foundation.<S>They wasted the money building luxury apartments n unaffected areas of the island in one case, instead of housing for entire villages who were destroyed for example.<S>Her corruption in Haiti led to many, many deaths.<S>This was what Trump meant when he said she's "taken many villages".<S>They even had a codeword "FOB" which meant "friend of bill" for companies looking to help in Haiti.<S>If you weren't labeled an "FOB" you would be ignored even if you had immense experience in disaster relief, and an "FOB" company would be given the contract with zero experience who would get nothing done and just take the money.<S>

Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>
Body: In cities, its basically a feel-good thing that at best lets people feel unity with others in times where they feel scared most of the time.<S>But in actual "civil uprisings" and shit, like with MLK's marches, its basically flipping off whoever's legitimately holding you down and saying that you arent scared of them, and you're so not scared of them that you're gonna walk through wherever they're strongest.<S>But most of these protests are going on in ultra liberal places anyways.<S>

Title: TFW you realize 200+ rioters will be getting slapped with a felony tonight and lose their right to vote.<S>
Body: I was joking...<S>But I also have no problem with requiring people to spend a few hours getting ID in order to vote.<S>The freedom to pick our leaders is a sacred trust, bought with the blood of millions of patriots over our history.<S>If that's not worth a few hours of your time, ok.<S>
