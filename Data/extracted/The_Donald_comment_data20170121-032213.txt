Title: From your Brothers in Arms over on /Pol/, Thank you r/The_Donald for your efforts in the Great Meme War.<S>
Body: Definitely didnt see this, thanks for sharing.<S>And agreed this is getting close to going over the top - such is the risk when you unleash the junkyard dogs.<S>And most weren't exactly fans of this dom either.<S>And none of this speaks to the general kind of content that appears there regularly - certainly plenty of truths for sure, but often posed with the crazy eyed, superior race theme underpinning it.<S>But they definitely had plenty to offer and it was the nexus of plenty election related content - FBIAnon being a big part of it.<S>CTR was doing heinous mass psyops, using intelligence agency level tools and obviously in clear view of (and with blessing) of those very same agencies.<S>That this sort of behavior led to militia-like counter intelligence activity isn't all that surprising and not even sure if I could admonish them for knowing their adversaries and their role in the surreal lurch toward a total surveillance state and in this regard, indistinguishable from what exists in all the most oppressive communist/socialist regimes.<S>That the government granted itself the literal legal right to brainwash its own citizens represented an escalation that almost required this sort of response.<S>If something else had happened, I'd be inclined to admonish them but this is actually exactly the sort of value pol brought - peeling back the facade and exposing the deep state's overt attempt to maintain control by any means necessary.<S>The fact that the entire thread you reference was unceremoniously wiped from existence likely within minutes or hours of its creation says far more about the threat we faced (and maybe continue to face) than the ones who have presented it to us<S>
