Title: What the fuck happened?<S>
Body: Reddit is playing dumb, but I believe this is a trick so that we censor ourselves right before the inauguration.<S>Just look.<S>Hot, rising, new, are all covered.<S>There's nothing else to see.<S>This is what they want.<S>
Title: This day will go down in history.<S>
Body: We also had 7 Trump pics on /all<S>
Title: I heard this portrait drove snowflakes into safe spaces, hot cocoa, play dough and a visit to ping pong pizza<S>
Body: Me neither, and I don't really have a horse in this race, I'm just watching from the sidelines as reddit crashes and burns.<S>
Title: Reddit admins, are you salty ?<S>(ಥ‸ಥ)<S>
Body: I think it was akin to "you're being mean, wahwahwah"<S>
Title: What the fuck happened?<S>
Body: &gt;some salty reddit admins banned a picture of Trump so we are retaliating?<S>Exactly!<S>
Title: I heard this portrait drove snowflakes into safe spaces, hot cocoa, play dough and a visit to ping pong pizza<S>

Title: Just a full page screenshot of /r/The_Donald<S>
Body: <S>
Title: HISTORIC: Trump's very first salute.<S>
Body: I'm a tough girl, but I cried (happy tears) when I watched this.<S>
Title: I'm just a simple shitposter, tending my portraits<S>

Title: Donald J. Trump has just boarded Air Force One in New York City for the last time as a private citizen.<S>He is en route, escorted by the United States Air Force, to Washington D.C.<S>
Body: True, his is cleaner, fewer press people have flown on it.<S>

Body: #OUT OUT OUT!<S>
Title: Try defaulting THIS photo to 0, admins!<S>You can't censor all of us!<S>
Body: Literally the same thing happened before they limited this subreddit from /r/all and introduced filters.<S>They claimed the algorithm broke doing routine maintenance.<S>I studied programming and dabbled in web design.<S>The only way this subreddit could take over /r/all is if *it was specifically referenced in their code*, otherwise we'd see greater diversity.<S>They changed something to specifically reference us.<S>Most likely to lightly quarantine, but for the second time in a row, utterly failed.<S>
Title: The official portrait of our President should be the #1 most upvoted post in reddit's history.<S>
Body: Apparently for some it is too hard to understand that Trump is not the the President of Finland and I have no reason to want him as the #1 post.<S>
Title: Announcement: We are so high energy we rolled the vote counter back to zero!<S>
Body: Someone change the scrolling banner to a bunch of these pics!<S>

Body: I'm surprised your keyboard works with all the tears you're crying.<S>OUT CUCK<S>
Title: Try defaulting THIS photo to 0, admins!<S>You can't censor all of us!<S>
Body: Probably this  I hope the Mods are in contact with the Admins or something, it's not our fault if their shitty site displays all our high energy posts on the front page, even if that's what we're aiming for.<S>We're playing within **their own rules**  Banning us for their own mistakes?<S>Let's not let that shit fly.<S>
Title: So does /politics literally come over to t_d and down vote our posts, in a sub dedicated to Trump?<S>It's not shit talking...What's the purpose of that?<S>Do they think it's devious?<S>Honestly I don't get it.<S>
Body: It's quite healthy for this sub, actually.<S>Everytime they brigade us, we push back harder than we started.<S>Without that brigade on the Trump Portrait, we wouldn't have like 10 spots on r/all right now<S>
Title: "Obama Should Pardon Hillary Clinton", Former Assistant US Attorney Says.<S>NO, OBAMA SHOULD NOT.<S>Hillary is a criminal and a traitor to the U.S.A.<S>
Body: I think The Donald has already talked Obama into NOT pardoning her, in exchange for leniency for himself.<S>Besides, he can't be extremely fond of her, given that she was rather impolite toward him during past DNC primary.<S>
Title: I heard this portrait drove snowflakes into safe spaces, hot cocoa, play dough and a visit to ping pong pizza<S>
Body: Right, because that's a rock-solid argument for global government.<S>
