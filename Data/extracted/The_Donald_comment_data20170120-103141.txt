Title: 1.5 hours left for this criminal to be pardoned.<S>
Body: my guess is if obama did pardon here, it would have already been announced.<S>I firmly believe that Trump was sworn in before he left Blair House or as soon as he walked in the WH for tea.<S>So, obama has no more power.<S>

Title: Centipedes...I fucked up.<S>
Body: Good, that was why I wanted to share, not only to absolve myself, but hopefully to show that someone completely set in their ways, surrounded by negative influence, can still change their mind.<S>A person can be open-minded enough to not only consider the opposite viewpoint, do some research, and give this supposed supervillain a fair chance when no one else will, but even be convinced that they've been wrong about a lot of things, and even if it means losing a lot of friends over propaganda, I'm not going to put up with, and pretend I'm in support of their bullying anymore.<S>Hopefully over the next few years, some of them will open up a little more too.<S>[If I can change...](<S>

Title: SURELY NO PATRIOTS WOULD DOWNVOTE OUR FLAG ON SUCH A GLORIOUS DAY, RIGHT?<S>
Body: I agree with your sentiment, but the fact is Trump lost the vote and Obama didn't.<S>The collective will favored one candidate and not another, so the opposition to Trump is not the same as opposition to obama.<S>It's in a different category of intransigence.<S>
