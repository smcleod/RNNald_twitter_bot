Title: Mark Cuckerberg is suing native Hawaiians to force them off their ancestral land so that he can build an island resort.<S>The tolerant liberal needs 700 acres all to himself.<S>Oh, and he built a wall.<S>
Body: Now hollup!<S>&gt;He isn't trying to force anyone off their ancestral land.<S>No one is living on that land and no one is being kicked off of it.<S>He bought 700 acres and due to arcane laws and fairly recent legislation, there are heirs that have quiet deed rights on a small portion of the acreage.<S>This is normal in Hawaii.<S>He wants to clear those claims and is doing it through the courts, as is required.<S>The court filings allow heirs, if they can be found, to come forward to receive just and due compensation.<S>I suppose a headline that stated the real situation wouldn't get as many clicks.<S>I think this would explain the situation better.<S>

Body: I know!<S>I can't wait!<S>What are you doing up?<S>
Title: One vote count Reddit can't roll back to zero<S>
Body: You shouldn't be downvoted for this.<S>**Trump won 2,626 Counties, and Hillary only won 487.<S>** Obviously she won the significant urban areas, but there's an electoral college for two important reasons:  1.<S>The urban, populated areas represent a very focused group of Americans, and 2.<S>That group is almost entirely consumers.<S>The majority of other counties (and largely other states) are producers and it's *very* important that a leader will enact policies in favor of production and business.<S>Consumption does not lead to a successful nation; production does.<S>Look at West Virginia as an example.<S>Thanks to bleeding heart environmentalists coal mines were closed, which effectively murdered the state as a whole and made us rely on other forms of energy that are significantly more expensive and far less effective.<S>West Virginia hasn't recovered by any means; if you drive through the state you'll see a carcass of something that was once great.<S>Not only that, the counties in which she won largely has no voter ID laws, and we all know how that works -- *never* in favor of the conservative side.<S>ID laws and cheating aside, it's very important to see the purpose of the electoral college.<S>It's not as simple as a popular vote where majority wins, because (a) the majority population in America is highly concentrated in a way negative to the country's health, and (b) the overwhelming liberal population in those areas make sure to pass laws ensuring their own side's success rather than any kind of fair democratic election.<S>
