Title: Calling it now, DNC is gonna double down on "progressive identity politics."<S>Next democratic nominee will be at least two of the following: Female, POC, Muslim, LGBT.<S>
Body: The DNC chair is between the progressive Keith Ellison (Sanders supported) and the 'principled' moderate Tom Perez (Obama and Clinton supported)    That being said the Democrat primaries are pretty interesting themselves in that whoever the party decided to support typically has the advantage of superdelegates, however without a full endorsement from Barack Obama the progressive candidate would be annihilated by the black conservative primary voters.<S>Say for example Sanders runs in 2020  but doesn't get the black endorsement in the best of best possible scenarios he would pick up from 2016 the states of Kentucky, New Mexico, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, South Dakota, Nevada, New Mexico and Massachusetts.<S>The South will never elect a progressive candidate in primaries.<S>If you're one you have to go Midwest or west coast<S>
