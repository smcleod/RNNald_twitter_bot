Title: MORNING/AFTERNOON MAGATHREAD - 1/21/17 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP EDITION<S>
Body: &gt;Absolute madman has fun with protesters  God that is fucking hilarious<S>
Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>
Body: Strange how some men feel emasculated when they have to compete against someone that isn't even half their size.<S>
Title: Never Forget Andrew Breitbart: This man gave his life for the reward we accepted today.<S>Never forget Andrew Breitbart!<S>
Body: Fuckin deep<S>
Title: Women's march appears to be anti-white male garbage.<S>Listening to Ashley Judd, these people are pathetic<S>
Body: Already had one gal on twitter try to fight with me and call me a misogynist ( I'm a freaking woman too) and tell me they wouldn't have to March for their abortion rights if we would just pay for their  birth control and their kids.<S>
Title: Woman fired, interviewed by Secret Service after tweet about assassinating Trump<S>
Body: Just a prank, bro  Wait, mom why is the SWAT people infront of the house<S>
Title: Femininity<S>
Body: the bigger issue for the movement (outside of the US) has always been against the catholic church though, for which the Marxist understanding is somewhat applicable.<S>Women blocked from education and freedom are kept as capital to produce labour force, hence contraception is banned; through this and many other mechanism Catholicism is the Christian "theo-political ideology".<S>the Jews, Protestants, and Lutherans have always been ahead on this, but not the Catholics.<S>for example, until quite recently the catholic church would not recognise divorce.<S>Could this understanding have been arrived at without marxists... maybe?<S>Ireland, yes, Marxists have never had a base there, Marxism is stupid and for people who don't take sovereignty seriously.<S>south america, I think they did.<S>without established continuous culture to combat catholic dogma, they needed to import a conflicting ideology.<S>in this way, imo it can be argued that Marxism has helped secularise otherwise dogmatic and archaic practices in south america, if only by providing a conflicting narrative to the role of women in society.<S>
Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>
Body: This is dumb.<S>You fight emasculation through being men - eg lifting weights, working hard, raising a family and not being fags.<S>I reject the insane levels feminism reached lately, but tbf the whole gamergate thing would never have happened if young men put down the gamepad and picked up some weights.<S>1v1 me irl if u disagree.<S>
Title: Donald Trump told us exactly what he's going to do in his "Contract with the American Voter".<S>Ignore media speculation.<S>

Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>
Body: Agreed, well said.<S>No matter how much any one bitches and moans about gun control, trump is not going to touch the 2A.<S>He values the constitution as a document which will guide him, not an obstacle to an agenda.<S>
Title: The Real Reason Trump Won.<S>
Body: I think this is a very well written criticism.<S>I would counter-argue that the bankruptcy bit really belongs on the ones who took over the casinos and properties after Trump sold his part out as part of the BK.<S>I would also present the counter-argument that his disposition to try and pay out contracts may in fact be what our federal government needs when you have utter debacles like the ACA website costing over two billion dollars and tragically behind schedule and not even working when it was finally put online.<S>

Body: &gt; pay taxes  But Trump himself has said in a debate (no fake news) that he doesn't pay taxes and that that's smart?<S>

Title: Are the kooky law breaking Trump protestors the best gift conservatives and Repubs ever received?<S>
