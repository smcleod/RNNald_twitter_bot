Title: My FB friend nailed what's going on right now PERFECTLY in this post<S>
Body: The correlation to self-esteem (or lack thereof) is tangible.<S>It reminds me of that infographic about the feminist/SJW brain.<S>And the corresponding article on Breitbart:<S>
Title: Just Wanted To Take A Moment To Point Out That Republicans Never Really Attacked Attacked Sasha Or Malia For The Entirety Of Obama's Presidency.<S>The Democrats Can't Even Get Past The Inauguration Without Attacking Barron Trump<S>
Body: Yes let's see if he's smoking dope and flashing his junk at a concert in 8 years on camera like the Obama kid did.<S>I'd bet not, he'll be busy spying in the Chinese from inside the Matrix.<S>

Title: IMPORTANT: The Trump team DID NOT delete the references to climate change, LGBT, and Civil rights from the whitehouse website.<S>The Obama team did.<S>All presidential social media resets with the new administration.<S>
Body: Pretty sure all the Whitehouse pages were archived and is now at   The Whitehouse site is for the current administration.<S>It wasn't deleted, just moved.<S>And most, if not all, articles will be back in some fashion, I'd suspect<S>
