Title: &lt;--- DID NOT GET PARDONED<S>
Body: Wrong.<S>Read the entire decision.<S>This time pay attention to the questions answered and those not answered, and the specific circumstances in Burdick compared to those with Hillary.<S>This "acceptance is admission" is most generously looked at as dicta but is closer to a generalization.<S>It's not precedent, it's not etched in stone.<S>Exceptions to this generalization abound, and are even noted by the court.<S>Also, the act of acceptance does not carry a requirement to provide a confession or admission of guilt in writing or by sworn declaration, as part of the formalization that courts require.<S>Lastly, the fact that a pardon does not have to detail the offenses it attaches to, illustrates the principle here.<S>
