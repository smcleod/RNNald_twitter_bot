Title: Just boarded the Trump train.<S>I hope it's not too late!<S>
Body: That's interesting!<S>It's almost like the left is eating itself alive when you put it like that.<S>Well, I've always heard that "if you're not a liberal when you're young, you're no fun; but if you're a liberal when you're older, you're stupid."<S>So I like to believe that there's hope for more of the millennials out there (I'm a millennial, too, but I was raised with conservative values).<S>I lived in a liberal hotbed in the south for several years.<S>I'm one of those people that can get along with almost anybody, and try to keep conversion civil, so as to not upset anybody.<S>So I rarely talk politics in public for this reason.<S>On Facebook, I didn't really talk politics until after the election.<S>I started sharing pro-Trump articles, and basically trying to calm the fears of upset friends who thought their worlds were going to be uprooted.<S>But then, I kept seeing friends posting those concern troll articles about "OMG, Trump is going back on his promises!"<S>So I pretty much came up with talking points in regards to these, and was accused of "deflecting questions" (one lady I didn't know even chimed in on one and said "Trump and his supporters are good at deflecting questions", which thoroughly pissed me off.)<S>I told the guy if he'd clarify his question, I'd do my best to answer it (he never did).<S>Others ignored me.<S>Some kept concern trolling after I schooled them.<S>But I don't think anyone deleted me for it (definitely not what I expected, I figured I'd lose some friends).<S>But yeah, it seems like most liberals are snarky and downright hostile about the election.<S>Glad you and your husband are seeing the light!<S>
