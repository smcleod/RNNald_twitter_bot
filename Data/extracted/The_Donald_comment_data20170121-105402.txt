Title: Piers Morgan: "I'm planning a 'Men's March' to protest at the creeping global emasculation of my gender by rabid feminists.<S>Who's with me?"<S>
Body: If I can throw my two cents in the wind here.<S>My personal opinion is that the focus of sex, race, ect, is a symptom of a weak mind.<S>What's the quote?<S>Average men discuss people, good men discuss events, great men discuss ideas?<S>There is no benefit to focusing on the traits of another.<S>There is no tangible gain.<S>If we wanted to avoid race relation issues, the first step would be to remove the prejudices towards that race, and work towards providing equality for everyone.<S>Everyone should be able to reach the same standard of living, given the same opportunities for improvement, and treated equally.<S>This is exactly how I feel about feminism.<S>You have to understand that feminists aren't reducing your status as a man, or even increasing their status as a woman.<S>In America we can say that at least most people, white/black, man/woman are given a chance for success.<S>When feminists focus on men and claim they are victims, you can point to Trump's campaign head and say "no, you can do this too."<S>When black people focus on whites and claim they have no opportunity for success, you can point to the myriad of successful blacks in America and say "this is what effort could give you, if you want it."<S>My point here is that if you feel emasculated or whatever, ask if you are secure with the effort you're putting into your own person, advancing your own skills and goals.<S>Whites aren't better than blacks, men are not better than women.<S>It's individual merit and worth that will make you feel secure, not some group identity you buy into.<S>
